    <p></p>
    <p>My name is Katrina, I live in Beaumont Texas with my husband and 3 kids.</p>
    <p>I have been a Member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day saints for my entire life.</p>
    <p>I am currently working at an Elementary School and I am pursuing a Bachelors degree from BYU-I in Web and Computer programming. I have never really worked with computers but I am excited to learn a new skill. In my free time I enjoy camping with my family and being on or in the water. We love going to the lake to go boating or kayaking, and relaxing on the beach. </p>
