                <h2>Fundraising Board Member</h2>
                <p>Hello, I'm April Hand and serve as the fundraising coordinator for the Silsbee Middle School PTO. I'm a native Texas who has lived in other states such as Florida, Hawaii, and Alaska. In 2022 my family moved to Silsbee so that my daughter could experience small town life and Friday night lights! 
                    I graduated from Yoakum High School, a small Texas town like Silsbee. I went to college in Houston and was a funeral director/embalmer for approximately 25 years. Currently I am a stay at home mom working on my master's degree in clinical mental health counseling. I can see the end. 
                    I joined PTO because I wanted to help support the relationship between the teachers, kids, and parents. I have a 13 year-old daughter in 7th grade. It seems there are so many distractions in the world today and our children are somewhat of a ping pong ball. I felt there needed to be a focus to not only support the teachers but also instill values and ethical actions as well as compassion among the children. The PTO has been rewarding and challenging all at the same time. I look forward to the great things the PTO is going to accomplish.
