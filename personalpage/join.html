                <h2>Fundraising Board Member</h2>
                <p>Miss April serves as the fundraising coordinator for the Silsbee Middle School PTO.  
                    I graduated from Yoakum High School, a small Texas town like Silsbee. I went to college in Houston. Currently I am a stay at home mom working on my master's degree in clinical mental health counseling. I can see the end. 
                    I joined PTO because I wanted to help support the relationship between the teachers, kids, and parents. I have a 13 year-old daughter in 7th grade. I felt there needed to be a focus to not only support the teachers but also instill values and ethical actions as well as compassion among the children.                 </p>
